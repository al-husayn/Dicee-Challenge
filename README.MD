Follow these steps to complete the tasks:
Create a new Javascript file called index.js and link to it from the index.html file
In the Dicee project, there is a folder called images, add the images of dice6.png as the
source to both of the elements.
Inside index.js, create a new variable called randomNumber1 then set the value of this
variable to a random number between 1 and 6. Test it out in the console to make sure it
works
Use the random number you created in the last step to pick out a random dice image
between dice1.png to dice6.png then place this image inside the left element. Hint: You will
need to use what you've learnt about the DOM and the method setAttribute() to achieve this.
Do the same for the right hand side image element
Change the text in the h1(which currently says Refresh Me) to show which user won or if
there was a draw depending on the dice values of the player 1(left) and player 2(right).
